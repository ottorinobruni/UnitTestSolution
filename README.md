# UnitTestSolution

This repository contains the source code for the UnitTestSolution project. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use Moq for unit testing in .NET projects with C# and VSCode. The project demonstrates how to set up and use Moq to effectively test components by mocking dependencies and verifying interactions.

## Usage Instructions

The main branch contains the initial code used in the tutorial. It's the starting point for exploring how to use Moq in your unit tests. There are separate tags and branches for different implementations and examples that you can review or download. Here are links you can use to jump to these tagged versions in your browser:
